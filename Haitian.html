<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">You never put your dirty socks in the laundry bin<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">Yes I do.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill:</font color="#0000CC"> No you don't because I have just done it<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony:</font color="#0000CC"> Well you never put the top back on the toothpaste<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill:</font color="#0000CC">Yes I do<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony:</font color="#0000CC">No you don't. You just kind of rest it on top so that when I pick up the toothpaste the top falls off, rolls under the bath and I have to scramble about on all fours to get it back again.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill:</font color="#0000CC"> That's not as bad as leaving smelly socks all over the floor<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">My socks are not smelly<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">Ha! That's what you think<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony:</font color="#0000CC"> And why do you always leave wet towels on the floor after you have showered<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">Actually I do it just to irritate you<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">Well congratulations – it does<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">And congratulations to you too. The way you always slam the bathroom door irritates me very much<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony:</font color="#0000CC"> I bet not as much as you irritate me when you always slam the car door.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">I have to slam it otherwise it won't close<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">It seems to close for everyone else that gets in the car.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">And you always drive too fast.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">No, you always drive to slowly. There are always about thirty cars stuck behind you.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">I drive safely<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony:</font color="#0000CC"> No you don't, you drive too slowly and then cars try to overtake dangerously<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">Then it is them that are driving dangerously, not me.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">You are in one of those moods today when you will argue about anything<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">No I am not<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">Actually, you just proved it<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill:</font color="#0000CC"> I don't want to spend the whole night arguing. What do you want for dinner?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">How about a casserole?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">I am not going to mess about with a casserole tonight<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">So why did you ask me what I wanted?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">Because if it was something I wanted to cook I would do it<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony:</font color="#0000CC"> In that case why didn't you just say this is something I want to cook do you want it?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill:</font color="#0000CC"> Because quite frankly I don't want to cook anything<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony:</font color="#0000CC"> Well I 'll cook then<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">No. You always make too much mess<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">No more than you<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">Far more than me<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">Let's go out to eat then<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">I can't be bothered to change. It's ok. I'll cook something<p>

<font color="#0000CC">Carey: </font color="#0000CC">I'll get these new brochures on the shelves<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Andy:</font color="#0000CC"> Do you want a hand?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Carey: </font color="#0000CC">No I can manage<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Andy:</font color="#0000CC"> I'll make us some coffee then<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Carey; </font color="#0000CC">Mmm that would be good<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Andy: </font color="#0000CC">I hate Mondays. Always so slow, hardly any customers<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Carey: </font color="#0000CC">Yes I know what you mean. Wow, these brochures are heavy<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Andy: </font color="#0000CC">Sure you don't want a hand?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Carey: </font color="#0000CC">No, I'll be ok, and I could really do with a coffee<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Andy:</font color="#0000CC"> when I have made the coffee I'll collect up all the out of date brochures<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Carey:</font color="#0000CC"> I'd love a holiday right now<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Andy:</font color="#0000CC">Yeh me too. Where would you go?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Carey: </font color="#0000CC">Somewhere warm, sunny with great food and cheap alcohol<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Andy:</font color="#0000CC"> Yes, that would do me too.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Carey: </font color="#0000CC">Miles and miles of Sandy beaches<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Andy: </font color="#0000CC">Warm blue sea<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Carey:</font color="#0000CC"> No work<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Andy: </font color="#0000CC">And not a care in the world<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Carey:</font color="#0000CC"> So where would you go?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Andy: </font color="#0000CC">Somewhere in the Caribbean probably, how about you?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Carey:</font color="#0000CC"> Probably the same for me.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Andy:</font color="#0000CC">Well we can dream<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Carey:</font color="#0000CC"> It's possible, after all we do get a discount<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Andy: </font color="#0000CC">Yes, that's right<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Carey:</font color="#0000CC"> We should try to go together, Tour operators often charge a supplement for single people<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Andy: </font color="#0000CC">That's true, they do but how can we go together, who would look after the office.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Carey: </font color="#0000CC">They have three staff at the Crawly office, one could come over here<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Andy: </font color="#0000CC">Certainly worth thinking about, Here's your coffee<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Carey:</font color="#0000CC"> I'll give head office a call when I have done this. It's worth a try.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Andy: </font color="#0000CC">Yes it is, I agree and I am sure we'd have lots of fun together<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Carey: </font color="#0000CC">Me too, we have always got on well here<p>

<font color="#0000CC">Glen: </font color="#0000CC">Hi Marcie. Glad to see you are on this flight today<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie: </font color="#0000CC">Hello Glen, Nice to see you again too<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Glen: </font color="#0000CC">Should be a good flight, weather report is good<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie: </font color="#0000CC">Yes I noticed that. Quite a small passenger list today<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Glen:</font color="#0000CC"> That makes life easier for you<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie:</font color="#0000CC"> Yes, much easier<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Glen: </font color="#0000CC">How long till they start boarding<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie:</font color="#0000CC"> About another twenty minutes. Have we refuelled?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Glen: </font color="#0000CC">Yes the fuel team are just driving off<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie: </font color="#0000CC">Time for a coffee then, would you like one?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Glen:</font color="#0000CC"> Yes please Marcie, that would go down very well at the moment<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie:</font color="#0000CC"> I'll bring it through to the cockpit for you<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Glen: </font color="#0000CC">No need to do that, I'll come through with you<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie: </font color="#0000CC">Ok then<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Glen: </font color="#0000CC">Everything stocked up and ready for the flight?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie: </font color="#0000CC">Yes all the little jobs done. The rest of the crew are in the boarding lounge<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Glen:</font color="#0000CC"> Martin, second officer, is in the cockpit doing the final checks so nice to relax with a coffee before the flight.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie: </font color="#0000CC">Quite a long one today<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Glen:</font color="#0000CC"> Just over nine hours<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie:</font color="#0000CC"> Did you always want to be a pilot Glen?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Glen: </font color="#0000CC">No. I wanted to be an architect but my dad was a pilot and persuaded me to follow in his footsteps<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie:</font color="#0000CC"> But do you enjoy it?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Glen: </font color="#0000CC">Most of the time, yes. We are always watching, monitoring and managing the flights progress, as well as keeping an eye on our various systems, but it can be quite boring sometimes<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie: </font color="#0000CC">Yes especially on long flights I suppose.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Glen:</font color="#0000CC"> ( A short laugh) It is a double edged sword. Sometimes I wish something exciting would happen but then of course that could be very dangerous and even fatal<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie:</font color="#0000CC"> Luckily, I have never been in that situation but it must be so terrifying<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Glen: </font color="#0000CC">yes I agree<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie: </font color="#0000CC">Here is your coffee Glen<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Glen: </font color="#0000CC">Thanks Marcie. Here's to a safe flight<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie: </font color="#0000CC">Always<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Glen: </font color="#0000CC">They should be boarding soon<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie: </font color="#0000CC">(sigh) Yes and then the rush begins<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Glen:</font color="#0000CC"> You asked me this Marcie, do you enjoy your job<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie: </font color="#0000CC">Mostly, apart from the safety demonstration. I always feel such a fool doing that ( They both laugh)<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Glen: </font color="#0000CC">I'd better get back to the cockpit, thanks for the coffee<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Marcie:</font color="#0000CC"> Catch you later<p>

<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">Just cobbled together some odds and ends from the 'fridge<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony:</font color="#0000CC"> Well it was very enjoyable<p>
(there is quite a long pause)<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">Tony – We haven't been getting on too well lately have we?<p>
 (a shorter pause)<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony</font color="#0000CC">: I suppose you are right Jill<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill:</font color="#0000CC"> I mean, it's not that we don't like each other<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony:</font color="#0000CC"> Exactly. We just don't seem like a couple any more<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">Do you think it is because we got married too young?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">That could have a lot to do with it. I was only nineteen. I have changed a lot since then<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">And I was only eighteen. I have changed a lot too of course<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">We kind of muddle along ok but I do feel like there is something missing.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">Yes I feel like that  too.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony:</font color="#0000CC"> The thing is, we are in our thirties now.....<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">I know what you are going to say. If we are just muddling along, are we missing out on something we could have with someone else?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">That is exactly what I was going to say<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">Please be honest with me Tony, are you seeing anyone else?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">NO! No of course not. I would never do that<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">Sorry, I just had to ask<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">Yes, in view of this conversation it was a fair thing to 
do<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">I wasn't accusing or anything.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony:</font color="#0000CC"> I understand that. So do you mind me asking – Are you seeing anyone else?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill:</font color="#0000CC"> (answers slowly) No – but if I am really honest I'd like to<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony:</font color="#0000CC"> What!! Is it someone I know?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">No, nothing like that silly. I am not talking about one<p>
particular person. I just meant that – well – maybe I would be more suited to someone else. Or them to me. We never do anything together<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">No, you are right. We haven't done anything like that for years now.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">So have we fallen out of love?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony:</font color="#0000CC"> Hmm, I am not sure.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">Nor am I<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">I think what it is, I love you but not in love with you. Does that make sense?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">Yes perfect sense. It's exactly how I feel<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">So what are we going to do then?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill:</font color="#0000CC"> I don't know. What do you think?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">I don't know either<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">I just think it is a little crazy to go  on like this.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">Yes it is. I know what I don't want though<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">What's that?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">I don't want us to start seeing other people. Not while we are still married I meant.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">Good I would hate that. You said though, while we are still married. Does that mean you think we should get divorced<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">To be honest. I am not sure what I mean. What do you think?<p>

<font color="#0000CC">Carey:</font color="#0000CC"> Maybe we could recommend somewhere else for you?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill:</font color="#0000CC"> Yes that would be helpful<p>

<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">No, far from it.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jill: </font color="#0000CC">Actually it is for a divorce<p>

<font color="#0000CC">Jill:</font color="#0000CC"> Once we decided to get divorced we wanted to do it as quickly as possible<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Tony: </font color="#0000CC">And Haiti it is granted in 24 hours<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Carey: </font color="#0000CC">Really? I didn't know that<p>

<font color="#0000CC">Jill;</font color="#0000CC"> That sounds perfect then<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Andy:</font color="#0000CC"> Hey Carey we couldn't decide where to go. How about the Dominican Republic?<p>
